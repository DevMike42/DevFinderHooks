# DevFinder w/Hooks

## Overview
A simple front end application for accessing the GitHub users api for searching Developers and displaying some of their profile information. This application was refactored using Hooks from another of my repos titled DevFinder.

## Technologies Used
* **React** - A javascript library for building user interfaces
* **React Hooks** - A new addition to React that allows access to state and other React features from functional components rather than class components.
* **Axios** - A Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
